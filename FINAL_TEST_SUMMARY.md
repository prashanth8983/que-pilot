# Final Test Summary - Live View Auto-Detection Fixed

## ✅ **Issue Resolved!**

The "presentation not running" error when accessing Live view has been completely fixed.

## 🔧 **Root Cause Found**

The problem was in the navigation button signal connection:

**Before (Broken):**
```python
btn.clicked.connect(func)  # Passes boolean (button checked state) to show_live_view(True)
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
btn.clicked.connect(lambda: func())  # Calls show_live_view() without parameters
```

## 📋 **Complete Fix Summary**

### 1. **Automatic Live View Access**
- ✅ Live view loads immediately when clicked
- ✅ No user prompts or dialogs required
- ✅ Automatic background presentation detection

### 2. **Continuous Auto-Detection**
- ✅ Attempts PowerPoint detection when Live view opens
- ✅ Continues trying every 1.5 seconds if no presentation found
- ✅ Automatically connects when PowerPoint is detected

### 3. **Type Error Prevention**
- ✅ Fixed boolean parameter being passed to `load_presentation()`
- ✅ Added validation to prevent boolean values in file paths
- ✅ Proper signal/slot connections without parameter confusion

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- ✅ Live view shows "Waiting for PowerPoint..." when no presentation detected
- ✅ Automatically updates when presentation is found
- ✅ Console logging shows detection status and slide content
